[ This file must be max 2-3 paragraphs, and is required. ]

This module adds severals fields :

* the *Supplier Payment Mode* and *Customer Payment Mode* on Partners,

* the *Payment Mode* on Invoices.

* the *Show bank account* on Payment Mode.

* the *# of digits for customer bank account* on Payment Mode.

* the *Bank account from journals* on Payment Mode.

On a Payment Order, in the wizard *Select Invoices to Pay*, the invoices will
be filtered per Payment Mode.

Allows to print in the invoice to which account number the payment
(via SEPA direct debit) is going to be charged so the customer knows that
information, but there are some customers that don't want that everyone
looking at the invoice sees the full account number (and even GDPR can say a
word about that), so that's the reason behind the several options.

Usage
=====

[ This file must be present and contains the usage instructions
  for end-users. As all other rst files included in the README,
  it MUST NOT contain reStructuredText sections
  only body text (paragraphs, lists, tables, etc). Should you need
  a more elaborate structure to explain the addon, please create a
  Sphinx documentation (which may include this file as a "quick start"
  section). ]

You are able to add a payment mode directly on a partner.
This payment mode is automatically associated to the invoice related to the partner. This default value could be change in a draft invoice.
When you create an payment order, only invoices related to chosen payment mode are displayed.
Invoices without any payment mode are displayed to.

Changelog
=========

[ The change log. The goal of this file is to help readers
  understand changes between version. The primary audience is
  end users and integrators. Purely technical changes such as
  code refactoring must not be mentioned here.

  This file may contain ONE level of section titles, underlined
  with the ~ (tilde) character. Other section markers are
  forbidden and will likely break the structure of the README.rst
  or other documents where this fragment is included. ]
